## phenix.js
A nice NPM add-on made by [Phenix H.](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHVAca-OHLlmf9GqFM3vBwQ) View me on [GitHub](https://github.com/GHPhenixH)!

I know that all my fans have been waiting for this NPM add-on and it is finally here! Download my new NPM extension! You can clone my JavaScript projects, use JavaScript code, HPM and many other features included in phenix.js!

## My firewall is blocking this. Is this actually a virus?
No, phenix.js is not a virus. This file just is not verified by Windows.

## Is this for macOS?
No. Unfortunately, we cannot make a macOS version because it requires macOS.
